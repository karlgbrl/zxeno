# Privacy Policy

The use of the ZXeno Discord bot ("Bot") in a server requires the collection of some specific user data ("Data"). By using the Bot, you agree to the terms of this Policy.

**1. Data Collected**
The Data collected by ZXeno includes, but is not limited to:
* **Discord User ID:** A unique identifier assigned to each Discord user. This is essential for identifying who executed a command and for features like displaying personal history.
* **Server ID:** A unique identifier for the Discord server where the bot is used. This allows server administrators to potentially configure bot settings and helps us understand bot usage within different communities.
* **Command Usage:** Records of the specific commands you execute and the time they were used. This includes:
  * **`{prefix}history`:** Usage of this command is tracked to understand how users access their in-game history (raid, claim, redeem, lottery, etc.). We may store the fact that this command was used by a specific User ID at a specific time.
  * **`{prefix}clan`:** When this command or its related subcommands (like tracking donations) are used, we may track User IDs and potentially associated data extracted from AniGame's embed messages (e.g., donation amounts from messages matching the pattern of `{prefix}cl donate <amount>`). This helps clan leaders monitor member activity.
  * **`{prefix}cinfo`:** Usage of this command is tracked to understand how users access enhanced character information. We may store the User ID and the character being queried.
  * **Other Commands:** We may also track the usage of other commands to understand feature popularity and improve the bot.

The purpose of collecting this data is to provide the described functionalities, analyze bot usage to improve features, and potentially for debugging purposes.

**2. Access to Data**
Access to Data is strictly limited to the Bot's developers and is only permitted to the extent required for the development, testing, and implementation of features for the Bot.

**3. Use of Data**
The collected Data is used for the following purposes:
 * **Bot Functionality:** To correctly process and respond to your commands.
 * **Usage Analysis:** To understand how the bot is being used, identify popular features, and inform future development efforts. This includes generating a usage counter for commands.
 * **Troubleshooting and Support:** To diagnose and resolve any issues that may arise.

**4. Storage of Data**
Data is stored securely in a MySQL database. While we implement reasonable security measures to prevent unauthorized access, no guarantee of absolute security can be provided. The Bot owners assume no liability for unintentional or malicious breaches of Data. In the event of an unauthorized Data access, users will be notified through the Discord client application.

**5. Data Retention**
[**You need to specify how long you retain this data.** For example: "Command usage data for statistical purposes is retained for [duration, e.g., 3 months], after which it may be anonymized or deleted. User and Server IDs are retained as long as the bot is active in the server to maintain functionality." Be specific about your data retention practices.]

**6. User Rights**
At any time, you have the right to request to view the Data pertaining to your Discord account that is stored by the Bot. You may submit a request by contacting `koshiro.gg` in Discord or through the [Discord Server](https://support.zxeno.space/). You also have the right to request the removal of relevant Data. Please note that removing certain data may impact the bot's ability to function correctly for you.

**7. Questions**
If you have any questions or concerns about what data might be stored from your account, please contact `koshiro.gg` in Discord. For more information about Discord's own data handling practices, please refer to the [Discord Terms Of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Discord Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).
